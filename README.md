## I solve problems. I build things. I make things better.

I'm a software engineer with a passion for building things that make people's lives better. I'm a big fan of open source software, and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to the community.

I'm currently with [KrakenFlex](https://krakenflex.com), a platform for managing energy assets. I'm also working on a few side projects, including [a plugin for Tailwind to support text-balance](https://github.com/theleoji/tailwindcss-text-balance).
